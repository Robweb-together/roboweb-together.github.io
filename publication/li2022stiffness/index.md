abstract: In the robotic machining process, the external force due to the end-effector (EE) and the workpiece can lead to significant deviations of the desired trajectory. In addition, moving platforms have been added to many heavy-duty industrial robots to improve the workspace. The combination of a moving platform and a six-degree-of-freedom industrial robot constitutes the redundant robot system. However, the effect of moving platforms is rarely considered in the redundant robot system for deflection analysis. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of traditional methods for joint stiffness modeling. Considering the advantages and limitations of traditional methods, we propose an effective method for redundant heavy-duty robot stiffness modeling by considering joint and moving platform compliances. Firstly, the relationship equations of the joints and the end-effector (EE) deformation are derived. Secondly, the static equilibrium equations of the moving platform are established in its stiffness matrix expression, and then the whole redundant robot system stiffness model is derived. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the correctness of the stiffness model. This work can be used for motion planning of redundant serial robots and optimization of machining operations.

summary: This paper proposes an effective method for modeling the stiffness of a redundant heavy-duty robot system, which considers joint and moving platform compliances. The method derives the relationship equations of the joints and end-effector deformation, establishes static equilibrium equations of the moving platform, and derives the whole stiffness model of the system. The simulations show the correctness of the model, which can be used for motion planning and optimization of machining operations.
