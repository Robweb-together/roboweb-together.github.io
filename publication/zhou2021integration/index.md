abstract: Lower limb rehabilitation exoskeletons (LLREs) are widely researched to assist patients with lower limb function injury, but there is a lack of researches on rehabilitation modes to help patients exercise balance ability. In response to this deficiency, the prototype of LLRE is introduced in this paper, including the design of mechanical, electrical and control systems. The kinematic models of leg abduction mechanism (LAM) and unilateral mechanical leg are established, and their workspaces are analyzed. Based on the prototype, an innovative rehabilitation mode integrating standing balance and trajectory training is designed. The training effects are demonstrated in the human subject experiments, the patient's center of gravity can be effectively transferred, the performance of the prototype is also verified by the trajectory tracking effect. The proposed mode is promised to enrich the rehabilitation mode of exoskeleton robots and improve the training effect.
