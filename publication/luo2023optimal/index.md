abstract: Accurate parameter identification of serial robots is of paramount importance to achieve satisfactory performance in performing highly dynamic tasks or obtaining realistic simulations. Focusing on the issue of optimizing excitation trajectory in the parameter identification process, a novel optimization algorithm is proposed by taking into account the interplay among different optimization criteria, in which the initial optimization index is introduced. To this end, the Lie-theory-based dynamic identification approach is introduced to illustrate the impact of trajectory optimization for the identification result, and we conduct a one-way analysis of torque prediction variance to determine whether significant improvements have been made or not. Finally, an experimental comparison between several optimization criteria is implemented for a 7 degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) Franka collaborative robot, the findings show that the proposed approach is capable of minimizing the overall trajectory optimization time while ensuring the identification robustness as compared to several other optimization criteria, which can offer a significant advantage in achieving fast and robust identification.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, we concentrate on the design of optimal excitation trajectories, a novel parameter optimization algorithm is proposed by taking advantages of two types of optimization objective functions. On the basis of the above-mentioned, the Lie-theory-based identification methodology of serial robots is introduced to demonstrate the impact of excitation trajectory optimization. Whereafter, we have conducted an experimental analysis on the performance of three different optimization methods. The results reveal that the proposed approach can significantly decrease the computation time required for trajectory optimization while maintaining the robust identification.
