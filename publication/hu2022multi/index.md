abstract: The performance of a robot is closely related to its structure. From the initial design of link lengths to structural optimization, it is still the research hotspot in recent years. To make the manipulator lightweight and ensure its working range and flexibility, researchers have proposed many optimization methods, most of which are for specific working scenarios, requirements, and robot structures, therefore their generality is limited. The optimization of the manipulator should be a comprehensive method. That is, we should pay attention to the joint configuration and each link length at the beginning of the design. Particularly, the geometric parameters of each link, which not only affect the range of the workspace but also have a direct impact on the working space, working efficiency, and flexibility of the manipulator. In this paper, a generalized optimization framework is proposed for multi-link manipulators. Starting from the optimization of manipulator link lengths, firstly, the geometry of the manipulator and workspace is parameterized; then the performance indicators are established; lastly, the geometric size of the manipulator is optimized according to the workspace limits and task requirements. Besides, we verified its feasibility and generality by applying this method to different TBM scenarios.
