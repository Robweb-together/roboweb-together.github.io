abstract: Compliance is good. However, it is challenging for one compliant continuum robot to finish both high precision manipulation and environmental-adapted motions. In this paper, a modular continuum robot with the alterable compliance characteristic is proposed. Besides, an actuation module is also proposed using a tubular-screw mechanism for non-slippage transmission. Kinematic analyses and dynamic co-simulation are performed to study the continuum robot. Furthermore, two potential application scenarios of pick-and-place manipulation and confined space navigating are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the alterable compliance design. This study presents a capable continuum robotic solution for non-structural inspection tasks, with potential for in-situ applications in restricted and hazardous environments.
