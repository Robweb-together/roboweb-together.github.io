abstract: Pipe robots are being developed to climb the areas that are hard to reach for human beings. Generally, there are few out-pipe robots that can both climb among pipes and pass through confined space. To this end, we propose a solution based on a continuum robot with several compliant mechanisms. This robot can imitate the locomotion principles of both caterpillars and inch-worms. The kinematics of the two-segment continuum robot is analyzed. Simulations including task space motion and confined space navigating are performed using a flexible multi-body dynamics method are performed for further discussion. Lastly, we showcase primary experiments of our proposed continuum robot for narrow gap exploration.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The development of a continuum robot with compliant mechanisms that imitates the locomotion of caterpillars and inch-worms is proposed for climbing pipes and navigating confined spaces, with kinematic analysis and simulations, and primary experiments demonstrating potential for narrow gap exploration.
